Homework #2

In HW#1, we began to use the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD) to develop a web application but we did not store the user data. In HW#2, we have modified the project to use a database for storing the results from our users.

The web application provides three tabs: Home, Grade Input, Qualified Students. The Home tab provides information about how the internship approval system works; the Grade Input page prompts for the student name, the letter grades for CSC141, CSC142, CSC240, and CSC241 and the system computes the Partial GPA based on the four courses and displays the numeric grade to the first digit after the decimal point; the third tab Qualified Students shows a list of students whose Partial GPA is greater than or equal to 2.5.

Everyone needs to submit the same code in a compressed file (.zip). Tester needs to submit the testing file. Everyone needs to submit an individual Word document to answer the following questions:

How do you test your web application? What are the components you need to test?
What method or methods that we taught you may use to test a database application?
How do you know if your web User Interface component initially works? What methods will be used?
How do you know if your database component works? What methods will you use?
